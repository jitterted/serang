# Serang

Minimal event-sourcing library for Java (JVM).

Name from [the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serang) in the Java region.
I picked the name because it was unique and started with the same letters as Event Sourcing (though reversed, which also works in the context of event-sourcing!).
